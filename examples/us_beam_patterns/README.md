# Simulating Ultrasound Beam Patterns Example

 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/master/examples/us_beam_patterns/us_beam_patterns.ipynb)

This example shows how the nonlinear beam pattern from an ultrasound transducer can be modelled. It builds on the Defining An Ultrasound Transducer and Simulating Transducer Field Patterns examples.
