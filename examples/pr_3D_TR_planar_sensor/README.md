# 3D FFT Reconstruction For A Planar Sensor Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](todo)

This example demonstrates the use of k-Wave for the reconstruction of a three-dimensional photoacoustic wave-field recorded  over a planar array of sensor elements.  The sensor data is simulated and then time-reversed using [kspaceFirstOrder3D](https://k-wave-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kwave.kspaceFirstOrder3D.html). It builds on the [3D FFT Reconstruction For A Planar Sensor](../pr_3D_FFT_planar_sensor/) and [2D Time Reversal Reconstruction For A Line Sensor](../pr_2D_TR_line_sensor) examples.
