# Examples

Many examples from k-wave-python are Python mirrors of the [large collection of great examples](http://www.k-wave.org/documentation/k-wave_examples.php) from the original k-wave project.

## Example directory layout

All examples are included as python files or ipython notebooks in a subdirectory of the example directory.
Every example has a short readme.md file which briefly describes the purpose of the example.

## Contributing new examples

When adding a new example notebook, follow these steps:

1. Search the open issues to see if a related example has already been requested. If not add an example issue.
3. Clone the repository and create a branch for your new example.
2. Create an example sub-directory, following the \<naming convention to be decided\>.
3. Add your example notebook or files to your created directory.
4. Add a readme.md file to your example, describing the concept or principle the example is meant to display.
5. Include a link in the readme.md in the examples directory to a collab notebook for your example.
7. Open a pull request that [closes the open issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) from your forked example branch and name pull request "[Example] \<name of your example\>".
