# Simulating B-mode Ultrasound Images From a Phased Array Transducer Example

 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/HEAD/examples/us_bmode_phased_array/us_bmode_phased_array.ipynb)

This example illustrates how k-wave-python can be used for the simulation of B-mode ultrasound images (including tissue harmonic imaging) analogous to those produced by a modern diagnostic ultrasound scanner.
Specifically, it demonstrates the usage of a phased array transducer. In this case, the entire medium should fit into the kgrid.
