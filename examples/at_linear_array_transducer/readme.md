# Modelling A Linear Array Transducer Example

This example provides a demonstration of using the kWaveArray class to define a linear array transducer with 15 rectangular elements. Electronic focusing is then used to transmit an ultrasound pulse. It builds on the [Defining A Source Using An Array Transducer Example](../at_array_as_a_source/).
