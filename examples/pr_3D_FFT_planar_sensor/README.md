# 3D FFT Reconstruction For A Planar Sensor Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](todo)

This example demonstrates the use of k-Wave for the reconstruction of a three-dimensional photoacoustic wave-field recorded over a planar array of sensor elements. The sensor data is simulated using [kspaceFirstOrder3D](https://k-wave-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kwave.kspaceFirstOrder3D.html) and reconstructed using kspacePlaneRecon. It builds on the Simulations In Three Dimensions and [2D FFT Reconstruction For A Line Sensor](../pr_3D_FFT_planar_sensor/) examples.
