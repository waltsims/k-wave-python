# 2D Time Reversal Reconstruction For A Line Sensor Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/master/examples/pr_2D_TR_line_sensor/pr_2D_TR_line_sensor.ipynb)

This example demonstrates the use of k-Wave for the time-reversal reconstruction of a two-dimensional photoacoustic wave-field recorded over a linear array of sensor elements. The sensor data is simulated and then time-reversed using [kspaceFirstOrder2D](https://k-wave-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kwave.kspaceFirstOrder2D.html). It builds on the [2D FFT Reconstruction For A Line Sensor Example](../pr_2D_TR_line_sensor/).
