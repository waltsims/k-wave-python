# Defining A Source Using An Array Transducer Example

This example provides a demonstration of using the kWaveArray class to define an array transducer with three arc-shaped elements without staircasing errors.

For a more detailed discussion of this example and the underlying techniques, see E. S. Wise, B. T. Cox, J. Jaros, & B. E. Treeby (2019).
