# Focussed Detector In 2D Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/master/examples/sd_focussed_detector_2D/sd_focussed_detector_2D.ipynb)

This example shows how k-Wave-python can be used to model the output of a focussed semicircular detector where the directionality arises from spatially averaging across the detector surface.
