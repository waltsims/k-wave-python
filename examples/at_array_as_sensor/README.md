# Defining A Sensor Using An Array Transducer Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/master/examples/at_array_as_sensor/at_array_as_sensor.ipynb)

This example provides a demonstration of using the kWaveArray class to define an array transducer with 20 arc-shaped elements which is then used as a receiver array. It builds on the Defining A Source Using An Array Transducer Example.
