Development Environment
=======================

Currently, this package serves as an interface to the cpp binaries of k-Wave.
For this reason, binaries are required to run simulations with `k-Wave-python`.
The binaries are downloaded by k-Wave-python when the package is run for the first time.

To correctly set up your development environment for this repository, clone the repository from github, and install the project dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/waltsims/k-wave-python
    cd k-wave-python
    pip install -e '.[dev,test]' 

This installs all the dependencies for development, and testing.

Ensure pre-commit is configured by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pre-commit install

Test References
=======================

Tests compare the outputs of the python and the matlab interfaces.
These tests are located in the ``tests`` directory. The comparison between ``matlab`` and ``python`` outputs are done in two ways:

- **Unit testing**: k-Wave-python functions that have a direct counterpart in original k-Wave are tested by comparing the outputs of the two functions.
  The output of the original k-Wave functions are stored in ``.mat`` files.
  These files can be generated by running the corresponding MATLAB scripts located in the ``tests/matlab_test_data_collectors/matlab_collectors/`` directory by running ``tests/matlab_test_data_collectors/run_all_collectors.m``.
  After running the scripts, the reference files can be found in ``tests/matlab_test_data_collectors/python_testes/collectedValues/``.
 
.. note::
    If you do not have MATLAB installed to generate the reference files, you can download recently generated reference file outputs from the GitHub CI and place them in the ``python_testers/collectedValues/`` directory.
    The latest reference files can be found in the artifacts of the latest CI run of ``pytest.yml`` (e.g. `here <https://github.com/waltsims/k-wave-python/actions/runs/7770639710/artifacts/1217868112>`_).

- **Integration testing**: k-Wave-python tests output .h5 files that are passed to the k-Wave binaries and ensures that they match the output of the original k-Wave.
  This testing compares the output for many of the example scripts from the original k-Wave package.
  Hash values of the reference output ``.h5`` file from MATLAB examples are generated and stored in ``.json`` files in ``tests/reference_outputs/``.
  These ``.json`` files are stored in the code repository and do not need to be regenerated.
  Since these files are generated from the original k-Wave package, they only need to be updated when a new release of k-Wave is made.

**Matlab reference file generation** is a bit involved process. Below are the steps that describe the process.

#. Open desired example in matlab, e.g. `example_pr_2D_TR_directional_sensors.m <https://github.com/ucl-bug/k-wave/blob/main/k-Wave/examples/example_pr_2D_TR_directional_sensors.m>`_
#. Find the lines where the call to one of the `kSpaceFirstOrder-family` function is made. For example,

    .. code-block:: python
    
        input_args = {'PMLInside', false, 'PMLSize', PML_size, 'PlotPML', false, 'Smooth', false};
        sensor_data = kspaceFirstOrder2D(kgrid, medium, source, sensor, input_args{:});

#. Update the ``input_args`` field by adding two new options - ``{'SaveToDisk', true, 'SaveToDiskExit': true}``. These options will ensure that we a ``.h5`` file will be created and saved in your ``tmp`` folder, while avoiding to run the actual simulation.
#. Run the modified example. You will find created files in your ``tmp`` folder. Usually exact file name depends on how many calls are made to the `kSpaceFirstOrder-family` function in the example:
    * If there is only a single call, created file name will be ``example_input.h5``
    * If there are two or more calls, created files will have names like ``example_input_1.h5``, ``example_input_2.h5``, ``example_input_3.h5`` and so on
#. Now it is time to turn the ``.h5`` files to the hashed ``.json`` files. This can be done with the ``H5Summary``.
    * If you have a single ``.h5`` file, adapt the lines below and run the script:
        https://github.com/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/1f9df5d987d0b3edb1a8a43fad0885d3d6079029/tests/h5_summary.py#L92-L95
    * For multiple files, adapt the lines below:
        https://github.com/waltsims/k-wave-python/blob/1f9df5d987d0b3edb1a8a43fad0885d3d6079029/tests/h5_summary.py#L97-L106


To run the tests, use the following command:    

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest 

To run the tests with coverage, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    coverage run

To run all examples, to ensure they still run after changes use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    MPLBACKEND=Agg python run_examples.py

If you want to force the examples to run on the cpu:

.. code-block:: bash

    MPLBACKEND=Agg KWAVE_FORCE_CPU=1 python run_examples.py
